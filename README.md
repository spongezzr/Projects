# Projects

## Class Projects @ CMU:

#### - Deep Learning Class Project: 
      
      Written in Python.
      Trained a Fully Convolutional Network with COCO dataset to segment all people faces from pictures. 
      Constructed a Fast Neural Network with VGG16 model as our data labels for image style transformation; 
      implemented perceptual optimization that directly optimized the feature reconstruction loss.

#### - Machine Learning Class Project: 

      Written in Python.
      Trained all kinds of Machine Learning models with or without Regularization, 
      such as Naive Bayes, Linear Regression, SVM, Neural Network, etc. on a investment data, 
      to compare these models on all kinds of data, and to predict the results of different investment strategies. 
      
#### - Distributed System Class Projects:

      Written in Java.
      Three small projects: 
      1. Messaging and the Chandy-Lamport Snapshot Algorithm. 
      Implemented a Pit game with Chandy-Lamport Snapshot Algorithm in the distributed System. 
      2. Mobile to Cloud Application. 
      Built an event-search Android App that connected to a MongoDB to store all client activities. 
      Users can query for history data from the database. 
      3. Web Service Design. 
      Implemented different web services designs with simulation of series of BlockChain operations. 
      
#### - Python Class Project:

      Written in Python.
      Webscrapped twitter data that related to major stocks. 
      Used these data to build a machine learning model that predicted stock trend. 

## Other Projects:

#### - Matrix:

      Written in Java.
      Developed an Android App for users to post and get nearby alerts such as speeding, traffic, drunk etc.
      
#### - Tableau Project:

      Written in R and Tableau.
      Visualize Amsterdam Airbnb housing prices and their decisive factors on a map. 
      
#### - Web Applicatipon:

      Written in JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and Java.
      Back End:
      Created Java servlets with RESTful APIs to handle HTTP requests and responses.
      Built relational and NoSQL databases (MySQL, MongoDB) to capture real business data from Yelp API.
      Designed algorithms (e.g., content-based recommendation) to implement business recommendation.
      Deployed server side to Amazon EC2 to handle 150 queries per second tested by Apache JMeter.
      Front End:
      Designed an interactive web page utilizing AJAX technology (HTML, CSS and JavaScript).
      Developed an Android mobile app for users to search nearby businesses based on locations.
